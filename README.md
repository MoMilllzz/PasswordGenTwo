# PasswordGenTwo
First thing I did was identify the variables 
Second I tried to use DOM Elements to have the password actually generate - had a hard time with this but tried
Then came time to list the functions; creating the password + the alerts
This assignment was difficult for me, everytime I tried to add something new to the code another thing would break - was able to have the password questions generate but not the password itself.
